# Face-targeting-laser-turret
 This is recreation of my old project that used raspberry pi 0 to detect faces trought small camera and directed servos to aim laser at that face.
 This recreation is now made with raspberry pi 4 


This is the hardware setup:
2 servos (Waveshare MG996R servo)
camera (Raspberry Pi kamera V2)
laser module (KY-008)
buzzer (FC-07)

And here is what it can do with the simple 2D_no_optimatization software:
